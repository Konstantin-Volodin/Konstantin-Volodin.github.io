    \item Developed a mixed-integer scheduling model with 100+ constraints (instructor preferences, room capacities) to generate a year-long timetable, cutting planning time from weeks to hours and improving fairness and utilization.
    \item Implemented a production web app (React + Django) enabling staff to run scheduling scenarios.
